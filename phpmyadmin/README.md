phpMyAdmin
==========

[phpMyAdmin][1] is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of
operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing
databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be
performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly
execute any SQL statement.
